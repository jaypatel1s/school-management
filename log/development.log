ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs Classroom associations explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_associations` class method in your `Classroom`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
